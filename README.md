# scons-test

This reposity was made to learn and test [SCons](https://scons.org/).

To understand a tool one must build something with it so here are some programs, libraries and tests written in C, and built with SCons.

Libraries include bare minimum implementations of basic data structures such as dynamic array (vector in C++), hashmap and linked list. In addition there are some unit tests and other programs just for toying around (such as minimal example of how one could do inheritance-like functionality in C).

## Requirements 

Unit test library called [Check](https://libcheck.github.io/check/)

```sudo apt install check```

and a C compiler. GCC 9 was used in development.
